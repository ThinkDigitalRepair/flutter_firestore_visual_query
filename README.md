# flutter_firestore_visual_query

A visual way to query your firestore database for testing.
This package provides a simple UI for querying Firebase that
you can just plug into your existing code. This is useful
for testing queries without having to manually create functions and run the code.
It can be plugged in anyway, but a Drawer  EndDrawer, or full page widget is the best option.
I'm looking for suggestings, bug reports, feature requests and new UIs, pull requests and more, so feel free to contribute!

## Roadmap

[ ] Support writing map objects to firebase.

[ ] Multiple ways of rendering widgets. Ie. Pagination for maps.

[ ] Support for all datatypes in widgets that make sense.

[ ] New UI.
